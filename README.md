#Sleep Logging App for iOS/Android

A CRUD mobile app where users can log the times they fell asleep, the times they woke up, and how tired they were feeling.
Users can view their sleep diary in the history tab.

Designed for people who log their sleep after they wake up.  

#Logging Sleepiness Levels
There is a Energy Levels tab, which will show them the stanford scale.
The user will then be able to select from 1-7, which of the options they feel is most appropriate.
Then they select from an ion-date-picker component what day and time they felt that way. 

#Logging OverNight Sleep Hours
Utilizes an ion date time picker for users to scroll through the date/time
It is very explicit but at the same time the user has freedom to log earlier days in case they may forget.  

#Viewing/Deleting/Editing Previous Logs
A person can view their data through the history tab, which is further separated into two tabs, one Overnight tab and
One Stanford Tab.  The log is in chronological date order, meaning the most recent date is at the top and the earliest date is
at the bottom. 

Sleep analytics page is provided, with average hours of sleep, average sleepiness levels, and 
night of the longest amount of sleep.
